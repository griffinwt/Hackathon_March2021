    WorldData.ai provides an impressive array of news archives and sentiment scoring. Every article is analyzed through Natural Language Processing on a scale of -1 to 1 where anything above zero would be generally positive and anything below zero has a negative tilt. The scores we used were calculated by WorldData.ai so we (fortunately) did not have to classify tens of thousands of articles ourselves! Two things we DID have control over were news source and keyword selection.
    
    With regards to sources, we investigated both Global and Financial news. Examples of Global news would be "The Guardian", "CNN", "Nigerian Tribune", "Toronto Star", or "Newsweek". In contrast, Financial sources included outlets like "Reuters", "The Wall Street Journal", and "Economic Times". These sources had little to no overlap based on our results, giving us confidence that we were not victims of redundant research. We searched all of our keywords across both types of sources, including all features that returned at least 100 related articles.
    
    For keyword selection, we created the distinction of "Direct" and "Indirect" to differentiate our terms. Direct keywords had a parallel and often synonymous relationship with the target variables, including words like "oil", "pipeline", "drilling", as well as several target companies like "Exxon", "Valero, and "Chevron". Indirect keywords, however, had a varied range of relationships to our target closing prices. These were words like "Solar", "Greenhouse", "Emissions", "Airline", "Vacation", and "Sanctions". Some of the Direct keywords did not return enough results from the Global news sources to be included (i.e., "Marathon Oil"), but all of the indirect keywords found enough traction among both types of sources to be included as features in our model.
