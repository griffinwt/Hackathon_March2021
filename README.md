### Problem Statement:
> "This data science competition seeks to create an innovative solution to analyze the effects of news sentiment and biases on daily stock performance for top companies in the oil and gas industry. News Sentiments and biases have a significant impact on stock prices and consumer behavior. Contestants will be provided with the necessary news data, stock market data, macro data and company financial data." - [*RMDS Competition Website*](https://grmds.org/competition/news-sentiment)

## Data Cleaning & EDA

* [Data Dictionary](#appendix)

**Financial Trends**  
<img src="./images/all_closing_wout_mobility.png" style="height: 310px; width:660px;"/>
This graph shows four years of NYSE closing prices (2017-2021) for each of our ten target companies. The volatility is obvious, especially in the past year as the pandemic triggered a huge dip in March 2020. Interestingly, some companies appear to suffer from higher volatility than others. Here's a second visualization of the same data:  
<img src="./images/boxplot_price_distro_wout_legend.png" style="height: 310px; width:660px;"/>  

We see that Marathon Oil ("MRO") in the center has a low price but also stays very close to its median value over time, neither rising nor falling to any great degree. In contrast, Pioneer Natural Resource Company (PXD) takes on a vast range of closing prices, suggesting it can make or break the risk-loving investor. BP and Chevron (CVX) appear to hold the highest median value but also suffer some peaks and valleys over time.

**Mobility Data**  
Apple  
<img src="./images/apple_weekly.png" style="height: 310px; width:660px;"/>
This is a graph of the Apple mobility data - it was recorded in daily increments but for this graph it has been resampled at a weekly rate to provide a clearer trend picture. The countries whose scores were analyzed (USA, India, Russia, Japan, Germany) correspond to the top fossil fuel using countries with the exception of China for which no scores were available. The countries scores are further broken down into the categories of driving, walking, and transit, however there were no transit scores in the data for Russia and India. This led to a total of 13 Apple mobility features (USA:3, India:2, Russia:2, Japan:3, Germany:3). While this line graph undertakes a vaguely similar shape to the stock prices over the same time period, it did not prove to be particularly helpful with modeling and in fact brought down RMSE on the OLS model. Even more significantly, this dataset begins in early 2020, giving us little more than a year (~240 rows of business days) to analyze if we wanted to include it as a feature. Without it, we were able to include about four times as many rows using closing prices, sentiment, and indexes going back to early 2017.

**News Sentiment**

WorldData.ai provides an impressive array of news archives and sentiment scoring. Every article is analyzed through Natural Language Processing on a scale of -1 to 1 where anything above zero would be generally positive and anything below zero has a negative tilt. The scores we used were calculated by WorldData.ai so we (fortunately) did not have to classify tens of thousands of articles ourselves! Two things we DID have control over were news source and keyword selection.

With regards to sources, we investigated both Global and Financial news. Examples of Global news would be "The Guardian", "CNN", "Nigerian Tribune", "Toronto Star", or "Newsweek". In contrast, Financial sources included outlets like "Reuters", "The Wall Street Journal", and "Economic Times". These sources had little to no overlap based on our results, giving us confidence that we were not victims of redundant research. We searched all of our keywords across both types of sources, including all features that returned at least 100 related articles.

For keyword selection, we created the distinction of "Direct" and "Indirect" to differentiate our terms. Direct keywords had a parallel and often synonymous relationship with the target variables, including words like "oil", "pipeline", "drilling", as well as several target companies like "Exxon", "Valero, and "Chevron". Indirect keywords, however, had a varied range of relationships to our target closing prices. These were words like "Solar", "Greenhouse", "Emissions", "Airline", "Vacation", and "Sanctions". Some of the Direct keywords did not return enough results from the Global news sources to be included (i.e., "Marathon Oil"), but all of the indirect keywords found enough traction among both types of sources to be included as features in our model.

## Production Model & Insights
[Back to Top](#back_to_top)  
**OLS**  
The first model we developed was an ordinary least squares regression using the statsmodels package in Python. We used the NYSE closing prices as the base of the dataframe and then (left) joined all other features by matching dates. The mobility data, while thought provoking, only exists for roughly the past year, so it was disregarded in favor of a broader (4 year) look.

<img src="./images/wout_mobility_preds_1.png" style="height: 310px; width:660px;"/>

The measure of error (RMSE) was very good, indicating that the 10 close price predictions were within \\$0.65 to \\$4.47 of true values on average, as we might expect based on the consistent overlap between the black lines (test data) and purple lines (predicted close prices) in the image above. More importantly, however, a closer examination of the coefficients reveals which features were most critical to our predictions.

This is an aggregate table of the 5 largest coefficients (by absolute value) for each of the ten target closing prices. Each feature is preceded by the word "lag" because it was lagged one day in order to simulate "yesterday's" news sentiment as a predictive factor for "today's" close price. We can see that the Direct keyword "oil" from the Financial News database was one of the top 5 most important features for 8 of the 10 targets! Second on the list is the Direct, Financial search phrase "marathon oil", followed by the Direct, Financial phrase "Phillips 66". Tied for third was the constant added to provide a y-intercept that is necessary in time-series modeling so not particularly valuable to us, however the next four most frequent are also news sentiment scores! We see the Indirect phrase "carbon footprint" from the Global News sources and then three more entries from the Direct, Financial news bucket, namely "valero", "occidental petroleum", and "fossil fuel". What is fascinating about this return is that the news sentiment scores, generally speaking, ranked higher in importance than the prior day's closing price for most stocks! This study suggests that news sentiment can be a powerful tool on the belt of any data scientist looking to create a more complete, multi-variate model predicting closing stock prices.
