    "In this notebook, time-series processing methods are applied for forecasting oil stock performance as part of the requirements of the RMDS 2021 Data Science Competition. Here, the *Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports* are leveraged to generate insights with time series modeling. We have just over one year of daily mobility data, measured as the percent change from established baseline values.\n",

    "Google has provided access to this anonymized data in support of public health efforts to combat COVID-19. There is no historical connection of this data with oil stock performance and thus there are no currently established metrics driving performance decisions. Identifying trends in mobility and the impact of unique indicators will help our team make better decisions on how to interpret a year highly disrupted by an air-born pandemic."

    "> When zoomed into the \"holiday season\", we can see the relationship between the mobility trends more clearly. The peaks in residential data show the private celebrations held by Americans around Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Year. These are the %-changes compared to a non-holiday baseline so it is expected that all other indicators would display a downward spiking mobility trend. Distinct cyclic behavior in workplace mobility is evident weekly, and appears to correspond with dips in residential mobility. This could be an indication of data-seasonality which will hinder series stationarity if left untreated."
